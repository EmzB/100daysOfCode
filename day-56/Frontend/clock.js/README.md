Creating a Clock in JS
* Lessons learnt:
- Most of the heavy lifting is with CSS transitions.
- We need some math to calculate the positions of each number based off 360 degrees of a circle.
- The magic that makes the clock appear to be moving happens because JavaScript calls the time function every second (WHAT ? You mean it's not magic? :0 )
